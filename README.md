## Video Content

The video presents real-world experiments through a locally deployed interactive interface running on a local server, which enables real-time visualization and monitoring of both the ground vehicle (GV) and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

Specifically, the video shows:
- Real-time camera view and motion trajectory of the ground vehicle
- Real-time camera view and motion trajectory of the unmanned aerial vehicle
- Synchronized real-time state data of the ground vehicle and the unmanned aerial vehicle
